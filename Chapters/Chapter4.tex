\chapter{Modelling}

We used various techniques for the mass modelling of $\omega$ Centauri, so that we could make a good approximation to its dynamic and stellar mass. In order to do this, we decided to use two components (the stellar and dark matter mass) both following the functional form of the Hernquist profile. In this chapter we present the results of such modelling and hapter.
